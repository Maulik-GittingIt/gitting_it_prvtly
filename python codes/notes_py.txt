list:- sequence of elements which is mutable, []
    predefined functions:- 
        l1.sort():- sorts the list asc order
        l1.reverse():- reverses the order of elements in a list
        l1.append(8):- appends 8 into the list, at the last
        l1.insert(3,8):- inserts 8 at index no 3
        l1.pop(2):- pops element at index no 2
        l1.remove(21):- removes 21 from the list
        
tuple:- sequence of elements which is immuatble, (), can have diffrent types of elements. 
    predefined functions:- 
        tuple1.count(2):- counts the no of occurance of 2 in the tuple tuple1
        tuple1.index(2):- tells the index at which 2 is in the tuple 
        ⬇️➡️tuple1.index(3,2):- finds element 3's index no starting from index no 2, element before it wont be considered, till the len of tupe. 
        we can also define the end of the index search by adding a 3rd value.

        these functions accept tuple as an input:-
            len(tuple1)
            min(tuple1)
            max()
            sum()
            sorted() # retur a sorted list of elements in tuple1

        operations:- 
        1) unpacking:- 
            t = (1,2,3)
            a,b,c = t
            print(a,b,c) # a = 1, b = 2,c = 3
        2) slicing:-
            print(t[1;2]) #index no 1 se leke 2 tak
        3) concatination:- 
            t1 = (1,2)
            t2 = (3,4)
            print(t1+t2) #(1,2,3,4)
        4) repitition:-
            print(t1 * 3)  # (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
        
dictionary:- they are unordered, mutable, indexed => if we write the key the value will be sent immediately without the interpretor trying to locate the key like in list which search for the index, and they cant contain duplicate values, 

operations on dictionary:-
