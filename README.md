user defined functions :- 

1) we can use void instead of int to define a fucntion to so that we dont need to have a return statement 
2) functions prototype: it is used to define the POS of the user defined function and hence we can define the function later on in the code instead of defining at the top
3) how pointer work, what they do??
    so ptrs basically are type of a variable that can store the aaddress of a given variable and hence we can use to basiclly do anything.
    ptr is defined by int* ptr= &varibale 
    *(&varibale)=*ptr= value stored at the location mentioned by the ptr or at the address of the variable 
    call by ref;
